      Hey there! I'm really into programming and building web apps that not only look good but also
      feel great to use. My first web app was a movie search app which I'm quite proud of and I still use all
      the time. I have also just completed a full stack app using React, Node and Express that allows users to search for images/photos, like images, download them etc.
      I am now learning PHP and Laravel and I'm having fun!<br/><br/>
      When I'm not coding, you'll probably catch me at the gym, lifting weights, or just
      unwinding with friends on a video game. And if it's a chill evening, I might be watching a
      horror movie â€” can't resist the thrill! &#128552; ðŸ˜±ðŸ”ª
