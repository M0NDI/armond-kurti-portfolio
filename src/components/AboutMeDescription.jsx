      Hey there! I'm really into programming and building web apps that not only look good but also
      feel great to use. I love everything about programming and besides building projects, I also
      enjoy learning lower level concepts regarding computer science to get a better understanding
      of not just how I can get something done, but also why it works the way it does. I find it
      fascinating how we got from binary to punch cards to the levels of abstraction we have today!

      My most recent application was a photo gallery app similar to Unsplash where users can search
      for, like, unlike and dowload photos in various resolutions. It was built with JavaScript,
      React, NodeJS, Express and MongoDB as well as other things such as TailwindCSS and Redux
      toolkit.

      When I'm not coding, you'll probably catch me at the gym, lifting weights, or just unwinding
      with friends on a video game. I also do very much enjoy horror movies! &#128552; ðŸ˜±ðŸ”ª
